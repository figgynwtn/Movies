# Movies

This application uses ASP.Net Core, Visual Studio, Entity Framework, SQL Server and LocalDB.

The web application will store a database of movies that can be added, deleted, edited, filtered and searched.

I thought this has a good business value because so many people watch movies and someone like myself who has seen so many movies, I sometimes forget what movies I have seen specifically if I havenâ€™t seen it in 10+ years. So this is why I decided to do this as my final project.
